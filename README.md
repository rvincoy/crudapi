# Overview

Hello! This is my CrudAPI client repo.

I am demoing my API client built on Typescript and which uses a CRUD API server which is stored in another repo called typescript. Typescript is meant to be a server software and I normally would use another program like Powershell or Python scripting language as an API client but for the purposes of this sprint, it needs to be built in Typescript so that is where it will end up. This is closely based on the API Client Video Tutorial (link below). Thanks and happy coding.

# Future Work

I would like to be able to figure out why JSON.parse(body).Product (or any other columns) returns undefined. This is preventing me from sending it to the calling program in order to do some additional things with it. I know it will not be an issue with other scripting software.
